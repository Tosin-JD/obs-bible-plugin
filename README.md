[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This is a free bible plugin that you can use to display bible passages in Open Broadcasting Studio.
I made it with the intention of helping me to display Bible passages since I could not find a free plugin to display Bible.
You can modify it for your use.

### Your _song.txt_ file should be arranged in this format.
1.
O soul, are you weary and troubled?  
No light in the darkness you see?  
There’s light for a look at the Savior,  
And life more abundant and free!  
CHORUS  
Turn your eyes upon Jesus,  
Look full in His wonderful face,  
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim,  
In the light of His glory and grace.  
2.
Through death into life everlasting  
He passed, and we follow Him there;  
O’er us sin no more hath dominion—  
For more than conqu’rors we are!  
3.
His Word shall not fail you—He promised;  
Believe Him, and all will be well:  
Then go to a world that is dying,  
His perfect salvation to tell!

I hope that as time goes on, we would be able to add more translations. Thank you. God bless you.
